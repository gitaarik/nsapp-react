- ditch jQuery and use npm request package for the requests
- search for a good npm ORM to use for the managers
  good candidate: YDN-DB (http://dev.yathit.com/ydn-db/index.html)
- use the station manager to get the stations
- make the station manager use local storage to keep a local cache of
  the stations, should invalidate itself
- also create a station names manager that works like the station
  manager, including local cache
- use offline.js for offline detection
